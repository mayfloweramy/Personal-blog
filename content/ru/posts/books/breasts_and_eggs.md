Breasts and Eggs by Mieko Kawakami

For my 25th birthday, I was gifted a book called "Breasts and Eggs" by Mieko Kawakami. I'd read another book by her before, "All the Lovers in the Night." Honestly, I'm kinda torn about both of them, but let's focus on the first one.

Haruki Murakami went on about how amazing this book is, calling it breathtaking. To be real with you, I didn't quite feel that. I get the whole relatable struggle thing, chasing your dreams, and then feeling frustrated when things don't pan out like you hoped. And it sucks even more when people start throwing shade, saying you lack talent or guts. It's reassuring to know others have been there too, but when I'm reading, I want to dive into a world of hope, faith, and love. Negative thoughts aren't what I'm after right now. Maybe I'll give it another shot down the road, though, like I usually do with books.

What I did like about "Breasts and Eggs" was the main character's determination to kick fear and doubt to the curb, ignoring people's judgments to get what she wanted. In my opinion, it is crucial to continuously believe in yourself so that people's words cannot unbalance you and your decisions. That part was pretty darn inspirational. 

And there's this cool educational vibe about the female body that I didn't know much about. So, overall, this book took me on a rollercoaster of emotions â€“ depressing, uplifting, and informative. Talk about a mix, huh?

So, I can't just slap one opinion on it because, honestly, it was a wild ride that I don't regret. I'd rate "Breasts and Eggs" a solid 7.5/10. Cheers!
